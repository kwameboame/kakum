<h1>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Welcome to the “Kakum Social Accountability online installation guide,  an online resource that provides development practitioners, government agencies and civil society with a step-by-step approach to integrating digital tools into social accountability (SA) mechanisms.
This guide comes at an opportune time where social accountability play a central role in promoting and ensuring governments are accountable, transparent and representative and aid also duty bearers in developing and implementing policies that meets the needs of citizens. The “Kakum” guide will enable users design online tools that will enable effective civic engagement in which ordinary citizens and civil society play vital roles in monitoring public goods and service delivery.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>This guide is designed to assist practitioners design, develop and accomplish the following tasks:</dt>
<dd><ul class="first last simple">
<li>Build the capacity of project teams in the use of Kakum</li>
<li>Scope potential entry points for introducing kakum new digital tools to enable citizens to be actively involved in social accountability</li>
<li>Provided an alternative options for selecting and sequencing SA tools that can help improve transparency, accountability, and participation</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The Kakum E-guide is not meant to be prescriptive but rather an alternative option that can be added to existing tools already being deployed by project teams. The Kakum platform is designed to complement other social accountability tools such as Participatory Planning; Participatory Budgeting; Public Expenditure Tracking Surveys (PETS); Citizen Report Cards; Social Audits; Community Score Card; Public Hearing, etc.
It is the hope of Penplusbytes this guide will be a “living” document, which will be regularly updated and improved based on experiences from using new digital tools in social accountability projects and also with contributions from the Social Accountability Community of Practice.</p>

<p>This website was conceptualised with guidance and inputs from a number of people across the Penplusbytes Network, which includes staff members, technology consultants and ultimately citizens who are the end-users of the platform. These persons have made many valuable contributions to the design, look and feel of the website without which the website would not have much of the content, both words and pictures that it contains.</p>
<p>The kakum online platform (platformafrica.net) which forms part of the “Tech Driven Social Accountable for Results” is very appreciative for the financial assistance by the project funders, the Open Society Initiative for West Africa (OSIWA).
In particular, the project will like to thank officials from the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Protection as well as the School Feeding Programme Secretatriat and the Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty (LEAP) programme head-office for supplying the respective policy documents to be shared with citizens.</p>
<p>Last but not the least, a big thank you to Infosol Solution and Village Pixels who did all the design and technical work on the site and continues to help to maintain it.</p>

<h2>What is the Kakum?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-the-kakum" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Kakum platform developed by Penplusbytes is a collaborative and an integrated tool which enhances communication and information sharing between citizens and government. The platform innovatively combines an online platform, emails, SMS, social media and a mobile application to support citizen ability to actively engage duty-bearers in planning, implementation and monitoring government budgets, plans and policies.</p>
<p>The web-based Kakum platform has over the years been deployed to enable citizens monitor, share their experiences on government policies in key areas such as health and education. The platform has also been used to enable citizens contribute to the formulation of government development plans and budgets both at the national and sub-national level.</p>
<p>Penplusbytes is currently using the Kakum to implement the project “Tech Driven Social Accountability for Results” project which is intended to use new digital tools which will contribute to citizens’ ability to hold government to account within the framework of political and social accountability.</p>
